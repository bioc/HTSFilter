		CHANGES in HTSFilter VERSION 1.0.1
	
-- Updated citation information, minor updates to vignette

-- DESeq2, IRanges, and GenomicRanges added to Imports field, and HTSFilter and HTSFilterBasic 

methods written for objects of with DESeqDataSet signature (from DESeq2 pipeline). 
Examples 
illustrating the use of HTSFilter have also been added in the documentation and vignettes.
-- DESeq and edgeR moved to Imports field (thanks to Denis Laloë for the suggestion)

-- Warning message added when gene ID's are included as a column in the data frame

(thanks to Luc Jouneau for the suggestion)

		CHANGES in HTSFilter VERSION 0.99.3-0.99.8

		CHANGES in HTSFilter VERSION 0.99.1

-- Vignette updated

-- Made normalizeData a visible function
-- Changes to dependencies (include classes and methods for DESeq, include
additional classes for edgeR pipeline: DGEExact, DGEGLM, DGELRT)
-- Slight changes/additions to man pages and citation info (paper in revision)
-- Inclusion of methods for CountDataSet S4 objects
-- Inclusion of methods for additional edgeR objects: DGEList, DGEExact,
DGEGLM, and DGELRT now supported
-- Minor change in .perConditionSimilarityIndex() to use mean rather than sum
(in case of unbalanced experiments)

		CHANGES in HTSFilter VERSION 0.99.0

-- Version bumped for submission to Bioconductor.

		CHANGES in HTSFilter VERSION 0.1.1
